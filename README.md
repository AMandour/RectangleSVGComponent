Rectangle progress component for your canvas app!

This component has a number of input properties that you can use to customise the SVG without needing to edit the SVG code. 
Itâ€™s built of a few  controls â€“ an image (where the SVG code is), a HTML control, and a couple of labels which means that it will not impact the loading time of your app at all. It allows you to visualise progress/utilisation of various activities â€“ total annual leave days taken, total number of tasks completed, or items left in stock â€“ itâ€™s up to you and your use case!

â—» Value â€“ this property specifies the â€˜progressâ€™ value. This could be X holidays taken, X tasks completed, X items in stock

â—¼ MaxValue â€“ use this property to set the max value. This could be the total holiday allowance, total number of tasks for the project, total number of items etc.

â—» Percentage â€“ there is already a formula in this property so you donâ€™t need to adjust it! It will calculate the percentage of utilisation â€“ value divided by max value and multiplied by 100.

â—¼ BackgroundTile â€“ this is a boolean property (yes/no) to specify whether you would like the background tile to be visible or not,

â—» PercentageLabelColour â€“ this property specifies the colour of the font of the percentage label.

â—¼ PercentageLabelFontSize â€“ this property specifies the size of the percentage label.

â—» BorderRadius - this property specifies the border radius of the progress rectangle.

â—¼ LinealGradientHexValue1 and LinealGradientHexValue2 â€“  this property is responsible for the gradient of your progress bar, please enter hex values without â€˜#â€™.

â—» BoxShadow â€“ this property is another toggle. Set this to â€˜onâ€™ if you like to go the extra mile with your visuals â€“ it will add box shadow to your SVG which will make it look more modern. Set this to off if you want your SVG to be â€˜flatâ€™.

â—¼ TileTitleFontSize â€“  this property is responsible for the font size of the tile label (e.g. 'Project Completion')

â—» Icon â€“ this property is responsible for the logo in the component, this could be either an image within your app, or SVG code.
